VisualCalendar
==============

simple visual calendar phone app, designed for autistic children to clearly see their current activity and previous/next activities.

built for http://www.bingfund.com/autism
sibling app for iphone: https://github.com/boctor/VisualCalendariOS

The app integrates with an existing calendar. It reads the description of each event in the calendar and if it finds a predefined keyword, then 
the matching image is selected and the event is displayed with that image as an icon.
